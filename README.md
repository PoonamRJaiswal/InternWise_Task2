# InternWise Task 2: To-Do List Application

## Overview
This project is my implementation of a To-Do List application, developed as part of my internship at InternWise. The application allows users to create, manage, and keep track of their tasks efficiently.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Existing tasks can be edited to reflect changes.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks they no longer wish to keep.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed, helping them track progress.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and usability in mind.
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes local storage to retain tasks even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the layout and structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and enhancing the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the core functionality and interactivity of the application.
